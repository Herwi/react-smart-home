# Frontend for smart home recruitment task
It is the recruitment task written in TypeScript that I have completed. The task is to create a fragment of the web interface of a smart home system. At the moment, the system should support three types of smart devices: light bulb, electric socket and temperature sensor. In the future, it may be extended with support for other types. 

Used technologies:
* react
* react-redux
* react-thunk
* react-icons
* axios
* socket.io
* typescript
* interact js
